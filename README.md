# Comma-Sprinkler
C# application that modifies sentences based on a specfic set of rules. 

##Rules And Logic

As practice will tell you, the English rules for comma placement are complex, frustrating, and
often ambiguous. Many people, even the English, will, in practice, ignore them, and, apply
custom rules, or, no rules, at all.
Doctor Comma Sprinkler solved this issue by developing a set of rules that sprinkles commas in
a sentence with no ambiguity and little simplicity. In this problem you will help Dr. Sprinkler by
producing an algorithm to automatically apply her rules.
